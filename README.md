*Winter Quarter 2019*

This problem was supposed to be done by hand, but I got about an hour into it and knew I must've missed something. I looked over it and couldn't find any issues, so I decided I'd write a program to do it for me, since I am a human and make huaman errors. Looking back at it the code is super messy and way longer than it needs to be. I decided to upload it here as it shows how far I've come since early 2019.
