# Humble-NishiyamaRandomnessGame

*October 2019*

I watched a video on a game that you can win most of the time if you go second, I was curious about it and wanted to see for myself. Hammered out this code in roughly an hour.

Plans include making the game playable by humans, versus each other, or versus the computer. I might also try to optimize furthur, though it is fine up to hundreds of thousands of games.
