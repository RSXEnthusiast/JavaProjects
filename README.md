*Fall 2017*

Honestly I haven't looked at this code much since I finished it in 2017, and it's probably horrible since it was done so long ago. I does still work, and is a pretty fun turn-based game. I do remember that it took me forever to get the turn-based feature working, rather than making it run in real time. I also remember being pretty proud of it at the time, which is why it's up here.
