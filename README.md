# Bing Auto-Search

# Spring 2019

This project started when I got tired of using Bing just because they paid me.

Basically it runs bing searches for me across many accounts.

In the end Microsoft caught on to me and shut down the majority of my accounts. I also think my current phone number, used to recover accounts, is on a black-list now... Who would've guessed that a massive company would catch on to a single college student... I made a total of $40 from the project, so I really got more value in experience than in cash, which is what I really wanted. For reference, if my accounts hadn't been shut down, I wouldve been making upwards of $200/month, and counting. I mean if I hadn't enjoyed writing it wouldn't have been worth it anyways.

The worst part of the program is that the image recogonition only worked on a 1080p display with the scale set at 100%, as it clicks on things by comparing pixel by pixel to a saved image, so to adapt it to another computer one would have to retake the screenshots. I wanted to fix this, but it was a low priority for me and I was shut down before I got the chance.

I might breath new life into this program at some point, as it could be useful to automate other things on my computer, and this program could be used to automate anything the user does, as long as the process is the same every time.
