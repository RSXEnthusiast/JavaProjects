# Bing Auto-Search

This project started when I got tired of using Bing because they paid me.

Basically it runs bing searches for me across many accounts.

In the end Microsoft caught on to me and shut down the majority of my accounts. I made a total of $40 from the project. Was it worth the many many hours I put into it? Absolutely.

The worst part of the program is that the image recogonition only worked on a 1080p display with the scale set at 100%, as it clicks on things by comparing pixel by pixel to a saved image, so to adapt it to another computer one would have to retake the screenshots. I wanted to fix this, but it was a low priority for me and I was shut down before I got the chance.
