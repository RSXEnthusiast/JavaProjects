# Bing Auto-Search
*Spring 2019*

This project started when I got tired of using Bing because they paid me in gift cards.

Basically the program runs bing searches for me across many accounts through a browser GUI.

In the end Microsoft shut down the majority of my accounts. I made a total of $40 from the project, so I really got more value in experience than in cash, which is what I really wanted. If my accounts hadn't been shut down, I wouldve been making upwards of $200/month and counting. If I hadn't enjoyed writing it wouldn't have been worth it either way.

The worst part of the program is that the image recogonition only worked on a 1080p display with the scale set at 100%, as it clicks on things by comparing pixel by pixel to a saved image, so to adapt it to another computer one would have to retake the screenshots. I wanted to and knew how I would fix this, but it was a low priority for me and I was shut down before I got the chance.

I might breath new life into this program at some point as a GUI navigator for other purposes.
