# DiscreteMathematicsHW3

In my discrete mathematics class at EWU we were allowed to use any resources we wanted on the test, including our computers, meaning that there was not enough time to be looking stuff up, meaning that working swiftly mattered. I wrote this program to do one of the problems on the a test and the final to save myself time. It's honestly horribly innefficient and can't do more than 10 letters, but fortunately that's all we needed to do on the test. I'd make it more efficient, but I really have no use for the code anymore, so I haven't.
